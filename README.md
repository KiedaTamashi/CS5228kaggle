!!!!!!!!! Please use Xtrain_pre.csv !!!!!!!!!!!!

1)I have done data cleaning and preprocess in data_preprocessing.

2)Run data_preprocess for test data as well. Just change the parameter. 

3)You STILL need to use something like clustermap to find the correlations and decide the input to model. 

4)BUT I am sure that each column is a meaningful feature now. ——from TZW
